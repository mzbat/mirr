Security Architect < Systems Architecture < Securely Provision
==============================================================
Ensures that the stakeholder security requirements necessary to protect the organizationâ€™s mission and business processes are adequately addressed in all aspects of enterprise architecture including reference models, segment and solution architectures, and the resulting systems supporting those missions and business processes.

Task
====
Define and prioritize essential system capabilities or business functions required for partial or full system restoration after a catastrophic failure event.
Document and address organization's information security, cybersecurity architecture, and systems security engineering requirements throughout the acquisition life cycle.
Employ secure configuration management processes.
Ensure that acquired or developed system(s) and architecture(s) are consistent with organization's cybersecurity architecture guidelines.
Perform security reviews, identify gaps in security architecture, and develop a security risk management plan.
Provide input on security requirements to be included in statements of work and other appropriate procurement documents.
Document and update as necessary all definition and architecture activities.
Determine the protection needs (i.e., security controls) for the information systems) and network(s) and document appropriately.
Translate proposed capabilities into technical requirements.
Assess and design security management functions as related to cyberspace.
