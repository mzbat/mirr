Watch the clock? You might not need/want to ask all or any of these questions.

Italics - something you could read or paraphrase.
Bold - things you could dig into with a follow up question.  To “help” them answer.
First 3 are soft, last 3 are built from the technical job tasks.

“Thank you for interviewing with me today. Here at Blue Titan Cyber we use a behavioral interviewing style. I'll be asking a series of questions about experiences you've had and how you handled them. We want to be sure that every person we hire has the same qualities that have made us so successful.
There will be times when I will ask you for more information, and don't worry, that's normal. I will be taking notes - please don't let it distract you. The way we'll do it is, first, I'll ask you some questions, and then I'll answer any questions you might have of me. When you're done with your questions, we'll finish up. I'm excited you're here - let's get started.”

1. “[At first job on resume] Tell me about a time where your communication with others - type, frequency, with whom, about what - helped you build rapport or create better relationships and outcomes?”
a. How did they learn about the other person? Were their exchanges based on respect, or simply getting an outcome? Did they continue the effort? Did they only do so to get a result, or do they show a pattern of always working at relationships?
2. Describe a situation when you have successfully managed multiple projects or tasks simultaneously.
a. What planning or scheduling did they do to address the workload? Did they simply react to changes, or did they proactively stay on top of issues? Did they communicate reactively, or did they see this as normal professional responsibility and handle it well?
3. Tell me about a time when you needed to follow instructions accurately. How did you ensure that your work was correct?
a. What did the candidate do to ensure they understood the instructions? Did they write them down, or ask questions? What steps did they take to ensure that the work didn’t get off track? Did they do anything to make sure the final product was what was expected?
