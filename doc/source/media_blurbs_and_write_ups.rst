How are job interviews like the holidays?  They happen infrequently, they are super important to everyone involved, and they can drive us to drink; they also run more smoothly with preparation.  Already have a career in infosec?  Knowing how to write a good resume and interviewing are still skills we should develop.

Thinking about a career change into infosec? It’s a good idea to always have a solid resume ready for unforeseen windfalls (or temporary setbacks). Our volunteer reviewers have decades of combined experience interviewing and vetting IT candidates, and we’re ready to put our experiences to work, for you. 

Sign up for resume reviews or mock interviews (focusing on either soft or technical skills!). Certain times will be designated for walk-in. Please bring a paper copy of your current resume or your own laptop with a digital copy (no USB). 

Hiring? Feel free to drop off cards or paper postings first thing or during the walk-in periods.


After Action Write Up - Long Summary
====================================
18 people came through the Mock Interview and Resume Review Workshop (MIRRW).  With the help of recruiters, hiring managers, and experienced hackers we worked all day long reviewing resumes and talking infosec careers.  Seeing first hand what I’ve only heard about until now: 
Wonderful people with experience, and demonstrated talent, facing obstacles between what they are doing and their start in information security.  The group at BSidesNash consisted of [insert # of  volunteers] working with  18 interviewees including one high schooler, and  a middle school student. The sixteen adults had experience ranging from active and retired military, IT professionals, and telecom engineers.

The mzbat format for MIRRW presents the interviewees with a signup form asking, what is your top area of interview FAIL? The group on April 14th at BsidesNashville expressed their biggest problem, as answering the technical answers. They confused and surprised me with that answer.  Surprised, until I started looking into the numbers.  A few people were knee deep in interviewing and had interviewed recently - an interview within the last month.  Some people were 4-9 years out from their last interview.  Interviewees with recent experience had confidence and had no problem engaging technical questions and answers. Practice gives you confidence.  You know the answers; practice helps you express your knowledge and experience while giving technical answers.

Lastly, and i’m not sure how i feel about this.  How do you feel about this?  Most of the people that came through the workshop were experienced, talented, and employed “makers.” I built fake job descriptions for this MIRRW, hoping to give people a more instructive experience.  Far and away, the biggest dream job in infosec was penetration testing.  What the NIST 800-181 would call, Analyze - “Exploitation Analyst,” or “Target Network Analyst.”  When this group of people, all hungry to start in infosec, or move into infosec, were granted a dream job interview they chose breaker over maker.  This workshop reinforced something I learned a long time ago.  Your happiness _is_ your path to infosec, and this is the common thread that will make future MIRRW a success.  Helping people find their happiness thing.  The thing started at 22:00, BLINK, then look at the 04:00 on the clock with befuddlement, wondering where did those hours go.  Take the thing you are good at and love and keep doing it; the dream job will come.
