I've had folks ask about childcare for Mock Interview & REsume Workshop at DerbyCon. The point of the workshop is to help folks in a meaningful way that will, hopefully, help them get a job to better support themselves and their families.

That said, if you need help with your kiddos to take advantage of the free resume review and/or interview coaching, we've got you covered. I'll have a few trustworthy folks on hand ready to color, do puzzles, and keep kids occupied in the lobby area so parents can focus on getting the help they need.
