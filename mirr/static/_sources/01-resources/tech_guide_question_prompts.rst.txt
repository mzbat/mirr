Tech Interview Guide - Security
===============================

For the following roles: Application Security Engineer, Penetration Tester, Security Operations
Engineer.

Overview
========
The purpose of this guide is to help you get a taste of what interviewers may be looking for in a
technical interview. The questions here are behavioral in nature, designed to get you talking
about specific situations and how you handled them. Guidelines are suggested for evaluating
the strength of the answers. Remember, these are just sample questions, but you need to start
thinking about how you’ll answer story-type questions. These questions are designed to see
how well you know what you’re doing, but also help gauge your commitment to a team
environment and whether you’d be a cultural fit for the org.
Remember to be as pleasant and friendly as you can be! Your interviewer is likely looking for
confidence, but not over-confidence.
