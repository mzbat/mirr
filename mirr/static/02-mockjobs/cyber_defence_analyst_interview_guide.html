<h1>Interview Guide - Cyber Defense Analyst<a class="headerlink" href="#interview-guide-cyber-defense-analyst" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>5mins - interviewer reviews CV without interviewee interaction.
20-40mins - Interview
10-20mins - interview and resume ‘debrief’</p>
<p>Watch the clock? You might not need/want to ask all or any of these questions.</p>
<p>Italics - something you could read or paraphrase.
Bold - things you could dig into with a follow up question.  To “help” them answer.
First 3 are soft, last 3 are built from the technical job tasks.
For more sample interview questions one of my favorite resources: Download a sample</p>
<p>“Thank you for interviewing with me today. Here at Blue Titan Cyber we use a behavioral interviewing style. I’ll be asking a series of questions about experiences you’ve had and how you handled them. We want to be sure that every person we hire has the same qualities that have made us so successful.
There will be times when I will ask you for more information, and don’t worry, that’s normal. I will be taking notes - please don’t let it distract you. The way we’ll do it is, first, I’ll ask you some questions, and then I’ll answer any questions you might have of me. When you’re done with your questions, we’ll finish up. I’m excited you’re here - let’s get started.”</p>
<p>1. “[At first job on resume] Tell me about a time where your communication with others - type, frequency, with whom, about what - helped you build rapport or create better relationships and outcomes?”
a. How did they learn about the other person? Were their exchanges based on respect, or simply getting an outcome? Did they continue the effort? Did they only do so to get a result, or do they show a pattern of always working at relationships?
2. Describe a situation when you have successfully managed multiple projects or tasks simultaneously.
a. What planning or scheduling did they do to address the workload? Did they simply react to changes, or did they proactively stay on top of issues? Did they communicate reactively, or did they see this as normal professional responsibility and handle it well?
3. Tell me about a time when you needed to follow instructions accurately. How did you ensure that your work was correct?
a. What did the candidate do to ensure they understood the instructions? Did they write them down, or ask questions? What steps did they take to ensure that the work didn’t get off track? Did they do anything to make sure the final product was what was expected?
4. Other: build out or expand on the softer interview questions; the non-technical questions</p>
<p>5. This job requires constant learning to solve new problems.  Tell me what your problem solving approach is. How have you communicated that to your team?
a. Ask about knowledge and skill areas below.  Do they have a standard approach? Are they able to communicate to allow others what they have learned? Do they define each situation before running off to research? What rules do they always apply, if any? Can they learn in a group/team?
6. Tell me about your methods for assessing  and escalating incidents. How do you measure your success in this area?
a. How complex was the incident? How many details were there? Did they have a clear way of keeping track of the details? What was their approach to managing multiple, conflicting priorities and projects…did other work slide during an incident?
7. Tell me about your methods for isolating and removing malware.. How do you measure your success in this area?
a. How complex was the malware? How many details were there? Did they have a clear way of keeping track of the details? What was their approach to managing multiple, conflicting priorities and projects…did other work slide during an incident?</p>

Knowledge of cyber attack stages (e.g., reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, gaining access, escalation of privileges, maintaining access, network exploitation, covering tracks).
Knowledge of network security architecture concepts including topology, protocols, components, and principles (e.g., application of defense-in-depth).
Knowledge of OSI model and underlying network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP).
Knowledge of packet-level analysis using appropriate tools (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump).
Knowledge of Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) tools and applications.</p>
